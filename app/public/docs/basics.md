# Angular Training

The purpose of these docs are to help anyone understand Angular in-depth so you can really use it more efficiently.

This repo also has angular libraries that are exported into the @devcreate/* library (currently under development).

If you want to utilize Angular at its fullest, first understand the basics, then the advanced basics.

However, keep in mind that this training is a lot more thorough. It will go into the origins of these, and explain why they are needed in the first place.

## The Basics

First and foremost, take time to understand the basics. Angular's new tutorial playground is very helpful.
