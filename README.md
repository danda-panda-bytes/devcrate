# Devcrate

Devcrate is a collection of libraries, tools, and tutorials to help Angular, Playwright and Node developers.

The main goal is to improve the development experience for Angular, Playwright and Node developers.

The main highlights are:

* [Angular Packages that work with Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
  * Packages that make it easy to manage data sources, file viewers, navbars, side pane lists, dropdowns, demo cards, utils, and styles.
* [Playwright Packages to test DevCrate and Angular Material Components easier](https://playwright.dev/)
* [Node Utilities](https://danielmhair.github.io/devcrate/packages/)
  * Packages that make it easy to manage your node projects with included configuration for eslint.
* [Training](https://danielmhair.github.io/devcrate/training/)
  * Tutorials and training for Advanced Angular concepts (beyond training from Angular's docs)

## Demo

See the [Demo Site](https://danielmhair.github.io/devcrate/) for examples of how to use the packages.

## Installation

Depending on the package you are installing, use the following command:

```bash
