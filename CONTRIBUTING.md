Contributing Guidelines
---

`DevCrate` is an open source project. We welcome contributions via pull requests as well as questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues. Contact our team at [danielmhair@gmail.com](mailto:danielmhair@gmail.com) with any questions. Please also refer to our [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Create a fork to contribute to the project. This will create your copy of the `DevCrate` repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub and create PRs.

In the future, `DevCrate` will use Github Actions for its CI tests. Our tests are automatically run against every new PR, and passing all tests is a requirement for merging your PR.

* Create your branches off the `repo:main` branch.
* Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
* Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., `Adds new privacy policy link to README`).
* Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
* Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
* Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
